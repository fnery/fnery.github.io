I'm Fabio. I'm a data engineer with a particular interest in blockchain data.

Prior to this, I was a [research associate](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2yzMjKkAAAAJ&hl=en) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I developed [MRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) methods and contributed to scientific open-source software.

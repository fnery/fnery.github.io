Someone asked:

> Why don't you allow comments in your posts?

A few reasons[^1]:

- Simplicity ðŸ˜Œ.
- Comment sections are often low signal-to-noise.
- I offer ways to contact me. Sure, there's a barrier to doing so (easier to drop a quick comment vs. emailing). This is by design. I believe this leads to more meaningful exchanges[^2].

[^1]: I reserve the right to change my mind on this (or on anything else! ðŸ™‚).
[^2]: If I learn something new or I'm corrected, it will most likely find its way into a future update or post.
